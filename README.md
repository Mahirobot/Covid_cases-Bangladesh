# Covid_cases-Bangladesh

## * This repository is under construction. *

In this mini project I worked with a geojson file of Bangladesh to create interactive maps of Covid infection, population count and population to covid ratio. The images are provided below. To checkout the interactive maps run this ![link](<https://github.com/Mahirobot/Covid_cases-Bangladesh/blob/main/BD%20Cloropleth%20Map/Choropleth_Map_of_covid_cases_in_BD.ipynb>) file according to the #cell_numbers provided.

## Map for covid cases

## Map for Population count

## Map for Population to covid case ratio
![pop_covid](/images/Population_to_covid.png "pop_covid")

## Notes

[x] The data was taken on September, 2019

[x] Geojson file link : https://github.com/fahimxyz/bangladesh-geojson.git

[x] Alot of scraping and cleaning is required if you desire to create your own data. Editing this ![csv](<https://github.com/Mahirobot/Covid_cases-Bangladesh/blob/main/BD%20Cloropleth%20Map/cases.csv>) will save you the hassle.
